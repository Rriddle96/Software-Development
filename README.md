### <h3> Reasons for why this repository exists
This repository is here to show any work, completed or in progress to any future employer who may be intrested in employing me.

### <h3> Short Biograhpy
My name is Robert Riddle, and I'm currently an enrolled student at Southwest Tech taking their computer programming class.
Although I am new to programming/coding, I have always had an interest in computer tech and wanted to do something in that field.
I graduated from Canyonview High School in 2015, and after that, I worked in culinary for a few years before joining the military.
While in the military I served as an M1 armored crewman, where in 2 years I became a gunner/assitant commander, shortly after I was 
picked to go to basic leadership coarse and was made a Sergeant after completing the course. When my contract was coming to an end,
I decided not to reenlist and use the benefits I earned to pursue a career in computer tech.

### <h3> Why am I taking this class?
A reason I am taking this class is because as the tech industry advances, jobs related to those fields will also advance, or new jobs will be created that relate to the industry. Two of my end goals are using this class as a foundation for learning cyber security, and a personal endgoal for this class is to learn how a game is built.
